# Bayesian Pricing Model for Facilities Management

### ðŸ§  Goal
Build an end-to-end, production-style pricing model to predict energy margins across FM sites â€” with business-awareness, risk flags, and uncertainty.

---

### ðŸ›  Dataset
- Simulated energy usage for 6 months across multiple asset types
- Includes time features, occupancy, cost, billing rate, and margin

---

### ðŸ“Š Key Features
- Business-driven feature engineering (OOH flag, volatility, margin ratio)
- Bayesian regression model with uncertainty
- Risk flagging for low-margin predictions
- Hourly and asset-type level margin analysis
- Power BI dashboard via Azure Blob output

---

### ðŸªœ Pipeline
1. **Data Cleaning** â†’ remove inconsistencies, nulls, skewed values
2. **EDA** â†’ margin trends, risk patterns, hourly/asset impact
3. **Feature Engineering** â†’ volatility, flags, ratios
4. **Modeling** â†’ Bayesian Ridge with MAP estimates
5. **Deployment** â†’ Azure Blob + Power BI for business interface

### ðŸš€ Author Notes
This was designed to simulate a real job use case using sample data from my prior FM project â€” not just ML accuracy but business impact and decision readiness.
